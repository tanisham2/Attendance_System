### 📌 Attendance_System
This project implements a Blockchain-Based Attendance Management System designed to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way of recording attendance. Traditional attendance systems are vulnerable to data manipulation and lack transparency. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system ensures immutability and trust in attendance records.

## 🎯 Objectives

Prevent manipulation or falsification of attendance records
Ensure transparency and data integrity
Maintain a decentralized and secure attendance ledger
Reduce dependency on manual attendance systems

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Blockchain – For immutable attendance records
Smart Contracts – To manage attendance logic
Node.js – Backend environment
JavaScript – Core programming language
VS Code – Development environment

## ⚙️ System Features

Secure attendance recording using blockchain
Immutable and verifiable attendance data
Decentralized storage of records
User-friendly interaction with the system
Reduced chances of proxy attendance

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

User marks attendance
Attendance data is sent to the blockchain
Smart contract validates and stores the record
Records become immutable and verifiable

## 🚀 Future Scope

Integration with biometric or facial recognition systems
Mobile application support


Analytics dashboard for attendance insights
